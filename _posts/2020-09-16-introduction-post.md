What is _Digital Humanities_? Well, "it's the Humanities, but it's also Digital."

-[Nate Slater](https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com) 



But in all seriousness, my definition will be ever-evolving as I explore this field further. I think part of the appeal is that it is not defined 'in consensus.' By this, I mean that while we may all work in the same field, if you ask people to define Digital Humanities they will all provide different answers. (The link above is actually to a website that gives a different submitted definition every time you refresh the page!)


What Digital Humanities means to me, is that I get to work on projects that don't have to be traditional research papers. I can do more than write and print a literary critique. In my short time in the field, I've had the opportunity to establish a website to host an archival database. While I may write, edit, and copywrite hosted exhibits like a more typical academic, I also get to think about digital design components such as color design (color schemes sure, but also what colors are [web safe](https://websafecolors.info/learn)), site maps, page templates, even the font I want to use. There is a whole other kit and caboodle of digital tools (like coding languages and how to make intuitive  instructions for my non-tech coworkers) that weave and meld into my 'humanities' work.

In the digital age, we can not only write about the changing geographic boundaries of Boston's Wards and compare where people were living using old census data (and there will indeed be a submitted article I edited on just this subject when the site goes live), but we can also create supplemental materials, such as an [interactive visualization](https://bostonresearchcenter.org/projects/early-black-boston-digital-almanac/ebbda-progress-update/) of the data. We used Excel files to digitize the physical census records, and an online program called ArcGIS to create a map based off the census data.

I think that the flexibility allowed for and the creativity required for this field is was makes it so compelling for me. Having plenty of background in the 'traditional' humanities, working in a digital space with digital tools makes my work feel more dynamic as well as more accessible to others. While traditional routes may put my work behind a paywall, and some are unfortunately, my digital work such as this blog are out there for anyone to see (though it is unlikely that many people without a direct link will be seeing this blog in its current condition).

While I will certainly go further into flexibility in my work in future posts, I'd like to highlight now one key component: the ability to link. A huge draw to working with digital publishing is the ability to link. I've already linked three times during this post, giving my reader the quick and instantaneous ability to see examples, read background information, and interact with new resources. There are, of course, even more reasons than that to use links (perhaps to engage on twitter, or purchase a book). The instantaneous ability to give my reader access something relevant to what I am discussing, whether you as the reader actually use it or not, is a major boon to this method of publication. 

So what indeed is _Digital Humanities_? Lauren Klein and Matthew Gold write "[w]e know DH in large part because it names itself, yet what it names seems increasingly malleable and at times difficult to grasp." My personal grasp of Digital Humanities as a field, is that ot merges technical tools and questions with humanities inquiry. While my personal defintion might change over the course of this semester of DH studies, I currently think of it as a field occurring at the intersection of **Humanities Studies** and **Digital Technologies**. It is a field that uses digital resources and techniques in research methodology, information dissemination, public engagement, and/or publishing, that engages in the theoretical work and pedagogy of the humanities. In doing so, I believe the work in this field _must_ also call for the **critical analysis** of the application of these digital resources. This critical analysis involves thinking about what programs, algorithims, and data corpuses inherently do as well what they have the capability to do when applied in x,y,z ways (and in 'good' or 'bad' ways). We'll see how my idea of DH changes over the course of my studies.
