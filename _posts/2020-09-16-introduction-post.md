What is _Digital Humanities_? Well, "it's the Humanities, but it's also Digital." [Nate Slater](https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com) 

But in all seriousness, my definition will be ever-evolving as I explore this field further. I currently think it is a field at 
the intersection on **Humanities Studies** and **Digital Technologies**. It is a field that uses digital resources and techniques in research methodology, information dissemination, public engagement, and/or publishing, but I believe it _must_ also call for the **critical analysis** of the application of these resources. We'll see how my idea of DH changes over the course of my studies.

This is a shell post for now, as I test this site theme. I'll have more actual words to contribute soon!
