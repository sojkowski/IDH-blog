title: Cookbooks in Voyant
---

For my last blog post of the semester, I have decided to return to more familiar  territory. For my undergraduate capstone, I studied cookbooks from the early 1900's, culminating in a comparison between a cookbook written by and for women and a cookbook written by and for men. This comparison was done by analyzing book structure, book dedications, and even making recipes of the same dish found in both books to compare how instructions and ingredients differ. I was not yet familiar with Digital Humanities methods, and as both of these books have been digitized I would like to return to them once again from a [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org) perspective.

The two cook books in question are the 1922 “The Stag’s Cookbook: A Man’s Cookbook For Men” and the 1915 “Suffrage Cook Book;” both of which can be found online. For those curious, pdf scans of the Stag’s Cookbook can be found at the HathiTrust’s Digital Library [website](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044087433777&view=1up&seq=19) and pdf scans of the Suffrage Cook Book can be found online at Iowa State University’s Library Special Collections and University Archives [website](https://cdm16001.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15031coll26/id/442).

While my previous academic interlude with these texts was more hands on, I'm hoping the step back through digital analysis may show me larger trends of the works as well as relay more information about the diction used, which is why I have chosen Voyant as my tool. The first, most glaringly obvious difference is in word count, which can be inferred from the page number differences as well. The Stag Cookbook boasts 197 pages and a total of 30,277 words (4,149 unique words), while the Suffrage Cook Book boasts a hefty 244 pages and a total of 31,195 words (3,624 unique words). The difference of 47 pages and 918 words (an average of 19.5 words a page) I believe can be easily explained by the recipe genre not being a particularly densely worded genre. Many pages will only consist of a short ingredient list and a couple sentences with preparation instructions, leaving the majority of the page blank.

Where this venture gets interesting is in each work's most used terms. They both have the same #1 word: "add." This seems to make sense with my own experiences with the texts and with recipes in general, they need to tell you when to insert your ingredients into the dish.

One of the things I wrote about in my Capstone was the gender dynamic in adding detailed instructions. It was clear that the Stag's Cookbook was trying to welcome men into the kitchen and assumed they knew nothing. The recipes were generally very clear about ingredient quantities, order, and cook time. In contrast, the Suffrage Cook Book made some assumptions about their readers knowing their way around the kitchen left some vagueness in their recipes. This was exhibited to me when I struggled to actually make some of these dishes for my Capstone and they become apparent here again in the common use of the term "little." The Suffrage Cook Book uses the descriptor such as "blended with a little water" 120 times. This is almost double the use of "little" in the Stag's Cookbook, which also tends to use the word outside of a recipe quantity such as "the kind you can get at any little Italian store" or "I like the dressing a little tart." The Suffrage Cook Book takes a lot of liberties in assuming that the reader will know how to do the basics of most recipes, including how to tell how much "a little" is.

There is also a weird dichotomy in measuring quantities that I never noticed before this analysis. While The Suffrage Cook Book use teaspoons and tablespoons frequently (197 and 231 uses respectively), the Stag Cookbook barely mentions them (22 and 19 uses respectively). While smaller measurements are not as necessary in the preparation of dinner meals, they are crucial in baking. This indicates to me that there must be a considerably larger number of baked goods recipes in the Suffrage Cook Book that use teaspoons and tablespoons of ingredients such as baking soda or baking powder.

One last note of interest that stood out to me in the Voyant word list was the use of spaghetti in the recipes. It was very high up on the Stag's list with 45 uses, and searching for it in the Suffrage Cook Book only revealed to me 6 uses of the word. I think this coincides with and strengthens my theory that the Stag Cook Book prioritized meals while the Suffrage Cook Book also included desserts. Yet other reasons are also out there, perhaps editor of the Stag Cook Book was Italian, or received lots of Italian submissions.

I think this experiment shows not only the capabilities of digital tools like Voyant, but it also exhibits how informative it can be to look at the same works through different approaches. Running both texts through Voyant expanded my knowledge even further than where my initial literary analysis and recipe making in my Capstone could take me.
