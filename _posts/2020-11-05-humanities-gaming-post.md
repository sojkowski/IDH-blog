#**Why Gaming?**

Video Games create digital spaces to simulate narratives of all types. I think when video games are discusses, the topic is primarily news stories portraying first-person shooters in a negative light. Picturing the entire medium of video games in this way is harmfully reductive, as simulations are a great way to teach and learn.

Video Games as a medium, put an engaged player in an imitated situation or process. By exploring and interacting with this simulation, they are actively participating and learning the rules applied to the simulation. They are doing basic things like learning the simulations gaming mechanics, but they are also testing boundaries, establishing social networks with other players and NPC's (a non-player character), and exploring their new environment. They are figuring out what "success" looks like for each video game, and in doing so they are realizing that definitions of "success" and "failure" are flexible. 

Their potential as a medium is astounding, and I think we are just at the beginning of using this medium as an educational tool. 



#**Why Does Gaming Matter?**

It is [widely](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/119/1/182) [established](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/142/3/e20182058) that play is essential to children's development, as it contributes to "the cognitive, physical, social, and emotional well-being of children and youth." Play supports relationship building, encourages the pursuit of goals, and promotes executive brain function. Additionally, play has been noted to regulate our body's stress response. Indeed, these benefits are why even adults are encouraged to use their leisure time to play. For [adults](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-health/benefits-of-play-for-adults.htm), play can improve and fuel your imagination, creativity, and problem-solving abilities, while also regulating stress and emotional well-being (as mentioned for children), teaching cooperation, improving social skills.

Bringing play into an adult life can improve the quality of your relationships to other, and can improve your mood in the short-term and improve your outlook in the long term. These are qualities of play that leisure time spent watching TV or reading a book cannot replicate in the same ways.

This is exactly why I think it is important to not overlook nuance when referring to video games, as when news reports 'video games are violent' they conflate a small genre (first-person shooters) with the medium as a whole (video games). Wikipedia lists [67 different genres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_genres) of video games, and that does not even take into consideration dozens of common subgenres and hybridizations of genres that are out there waiting to be played. Just like with music or movies, there is a genre out there for everyone. While video games have different levels of accessibility (some are inexpensive or free, some can be expensive and can require certain hardware specs), these varying levels mean that video games can be enjoyed and consumed by anyone at any level they are comfortable with. This medium provides adults and children alike with modes of play, and the benefits that come with play.



#**Simulation vs Simulator**

I would like to spend my next blog post actually interacting and discussing specific games, so I would like to lay some of the terminology groundwork here, where I am already discussing why this medium is of scholarly interest to me. Specifically, I would like to clarify right now the difference between a _simulation_ and a _simulator_. 

A key aspect of video games as a medium is that they are all simulations. Video games are all imitated situations or processes that the player interacts with and inhabits in some capacity. If I play _Overwatch_ which is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter, I am simulating the experience of a two team conflict. I can personalize that simulation further by selecting a specific game mode, and by selecting one of thirty-two playable characters in three different categories of character (tank, damage, and support). If I play _Animal Crossing: New Horizons_ which at its essence is a role playing game, but is dubbed by Nintendo as a "communication game," then I am simulating the experience of founding a brand new town on a deserted island, where I invite villagers, create social bonds, and decorate and garden the island as I see fit. A simulation is the new reality and set of rules that the player enters every time they turn on the video game.

This is quite distinct from a simulator, which is a genre. A simulator is a type of video game where a sense of realism is emphasized, giving the player the sensation of actually performing x, y, z tasks. For example, _Tabletop Simulator_ is a computer game on Steam (a hosting platform) that digitally simulates the experience of a tabletop board game or card game. Within _Tabletop Simulator_ you can choose digitized games like Cards Against Humanity, Monopoly, Jenga, Settlers of Catan, and the list goes on and on. Tabletop Simulator is a video games that creates the experience of playing a physical, tabletop game. It has become quite popular in 2020 due to Covid-19 preventing in-person meetups. 

It is important to note that not all simulator games are that literal in their real-life simulation. For example, in _The Sims 4_ you are given god-like powers over the everyday lives of digital humans. You can tell them to do real-life tasks like buying a house, and you direct their moods and try to satisfy their desires. While it does try to create a real-world experience, having god-like control over a simulated person is not quite the same thing as playing a digital board game or trying to drive a simulated car. Furthermore, simulators do not necessarily have to be practical in application— my mind is immediately brought to _The Goat Simulator_. Coffee Stain Studios have [described their goat simulator game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/265930/Goat_Simulator/) as "the latest in goat simulation technology, bringing next-gen goat simulation to YOU. You no longer have to fantasize about being a goat, your dreams have finally come true! Key Features: You can be a goat." The simulator genre uses video game's general capacity for simulation to create a very specific embodied reality for their players.

Essentially, all video games are simulations, but not all video games are simulators. Going forward, "simulation" will be used to describe the concept of interacting with any and all imitated/mimed situations, processes, events, and locations made by the creators for players to enjoy. Meanwhile "simulator" will be used to refer to the specific genre of simulator games.
